difference between malloc, mmap, hugepages

does my driver have support for xdp

what does it mean to mmap a memory region to user space? Why is that necessary?
What's the underlying mechanis of mmap? Do the page tables map a user space address
to kernel address space? What's the reason for the mmap rather than setting up a simple page table?

Please refer to the sample application (samples/bpf/) in for an example.

In order to use AF_XDP sockets there are two parts needed. The user-space application and the XDP program. For a complete setup and usage example, please refer to the sample application. The user-space side is xdpsock_user.c and the XDP side is part of libbpf.


The XDP code sample included in tools/lib/bpf/xsk.c is the following:
